## Initial Proposal

### Name of Project: Re-Roll

### Brief Proposal:
 An app that eases the barrier of entry to those wanting to try out table top games such as Dungeons and Dragons. It can be extremely daunting with all the information at hand for new players to make sense of it all. It simplifies the character creation into an easy form with some default characters if they choose to use those. They can save the character to their profile and can store items and other things they find in their adventures. Also to ease the lives of Dungeon Masters I plan to use the D&D API to allow for quick access to monsters, spells, and items with the ability to save them to a local API for future use.













## Application Overview


### What problem does your application solve? 

An app that eases new players into creating a character and playing D&D. It breaks up the huge barrier of entry that there is with this genre of tabletop games and allows new users to take in information in a much more concise manner. 

### Who are the target users of this application? 

The target audience for this application is new players to D&D. While it has functionality for those that have done this before, its main goal is to help new players break into the genre.

### What can a user do with this application? 

From logging in a new user should be able to go through character creation without having any prior knowledge needed. Once the character is made they should be able to view their characters profile and see their stats to use in the game. They should also be able to edit their characters to reflect what is going on in the game.

### Why do you want to build this application? 

I want to make this app because this is a genre I love and with how things are right now, having a digital aid to help you into a new hobby or a returning player being able to quickly hop in, is something that’s greatly needed. I know many people that want to play but see the character sheet and get overwhelmed by the amount of information needed and just stop there.


## MVP Definition: 

* As a new player, I would like the ability to create a new character from beginning to end in a way that’s easy to understand.

* As a new player, once the character is created I would like to be able to see it on my main dashboard

* As a returning player, I would like the ability to create a default character and just edit that.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to click my character and see a profile page of their stats so that it is easy to see and use.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to edit my character after it has already been made and update it.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to see other friend’s characters if I wanted to.

## Stretch Goals

* As a new player, I would like to be able to put my inventory items in a tab and save them as needed and delete them as needed.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to put all of my spells in a tab and save them as needed and delete them as needed.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to add character logs to remind myself of events that happened to my character in game.
